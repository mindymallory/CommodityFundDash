# CommodityFundDash
Dashboard of commodity fundamentals 

Planned components: 

- Get hisorical wasde history (see old blog post for examples feed grain database etc)
- Build api to AMS price data and build dashboard to view all this regional price data for a lot of commodities. Pull per request so we don't need to store all data and app can be lightweight
- get rail data from Surface transportation bureau. Have data on number of loaded rail cars, and freight rates https://www.stb.gov/reports-data/
